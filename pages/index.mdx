# Welcome to WebDev1.0

## Course Overview

WebDev1.0 is a **45-day online course** designed for **BCA, BSc (IT), and BTech CSE students** to build a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The course will include **daily 1.5-hour Google Meet sessions**, hands-on assignments, and a final project.

While the program includes a certain amount of theoretical content, it primarily focuses on practical, hands-on coding.

Success in this course hinges on your consistent engagement with weekly activities and timely completion of assignments.

## How to Succeed in this Course

1. **Embrace Collaboration:** All work done in this course is public, encouraging open collaboration. Don't hesitate to ask for help or offer assistance to your peers.

2. **Learn from Others:** Since all code repositories are public, you have the unique opportunity to learn from your peers' work. Explore different approaches to the same problems, review code, and adopt practices that resonate with you.

3. **Stay Engaged:** Attend all classes and engage with the course materials. Attendance is not required, but it is highly recommended. Timely completion of assignments and a continuous engagement with the course material is key to understanding and success.

Remember, this course is not just about the grades, it's about growing as a developer, learning to collaborate effectively, and continually improving your skills.

## Getting Help

No matter how you learn, sometimes you'll hit a snag or a seemingly unsolvable bug. When that happens, remember that you have multiple resources available to help you!

### During Class

- **Classmates:** Your classmates are a great resource. Remember that everyone is learning and someone might have a different perspective or have overcome the exact challenge you're facing. Be open to collaborating and helping each other out.

- **Instructor:** I'm here to guide you through your learning journey. During class, don't hesitate to ask questions, whether they're about the course content or broader concepts.

### Outside of Class

- **Classmates:** Even outside of class hours, consider setting up study groups or chat sessions with your classmates. This not only helps clarify concepts, but it also builds a community of learners.

- **AI Tools:** AI tools like GitHub Copilot, chat-based AI tools, or AI-driven documentation tools can be great for troubleshooting code problems, understanding new concepts, or providing new perspectives.

  **Avoid relying completely on AI tools when learning a new topic.** It's
  important to get a strong foundational understanding and form your own thought
  processes before relying on AI suggestions. Write code by hand, without AI, to
  strengthen your understanding.

I encourage you to utilize AI tools throughout this course. They can be a great aid for learning, debugging, and gaining new insights. However, remember that they might not always be up-to-date with the latest developments, such as the App Router for Next.js.

Despite the assistance AI tools provide, they do not replace the support and guidance of your instructor. Always feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
