# CPRG-306 Week 10

# Cloud Firestore

---

## Agenda

- NoSQL Databases
- Cloud Firestore
  - Rules
  - CRUD Operations
- Next.js Dynamic Routing
- Demo: Blogging Platform

---

## NoSQL Databases

- Non-relational databases
- No fixed schema, flexible data model
- Large scale
- Real-time updates
- Example apps: social media, maps, blogs, IoT, drawing apps

---

## Terminology

- Collection: Array of documents (table)
- Document: JSON object (row)
- Field, Value: Key-value pair (column, cell)
- Subcollection: Collection within a document (nested table)
- Query: Retrieve data from a collection
- Rules: Security and validation

---

## Design Considerations

- Data model
  - Typically, one query/document per screen
- Denormalization, no joins
- Query performance, Reads vs Writes
- Security

---

## Cloud Firestore

- Serverless, managed NoSQL database
- Real-time updates
- Scalable
- Integration with Firebase Authentication

---

## Comparison to JS Objects

| Feature             | JavaScript Objects                     | Firestore Documents                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Basic Structure** | Key-value pairs                        | Key-value pairs                      |
| **Data Types**      | Supports all JS data types + functions | Supports basic types, no functions   |
| **Nested Data**     | Supports nested objects and arrays     | Documents can contain subcollections |

---

## Comparison to JS Objects (cont'd)

| Feature              | JavaScript Objects             | Firestore Documents |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Data Size Limits** | Limited only by runtime memory | 1 MB per document   |

---

## Rules

- Security and validation rules
- Firestore Security Rules are written in a custom language
- Rules are evaluated in order
- `allow` or `deny` access to documents
- `request` object contains information about the request, e.g. `request.auth` for authentication

---

## Rules Example

- Allow anyone to read. Write only if user is authenticated.

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## CRUD Operations

- Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Example: Create a document

```javascript
db.collection("blog-posts").add({
  title: "Hello, World!",
  content: "This is my first post.",
});
```

---

## Read a Document

- `doc()` is a reference to a document
- `getDoc()` is an asynchronous function that returns a `DocumentSnapshot`
- `doc.data()` is a method that returns the document data

```javascript
const docRef = doc(db, "blog-posts", id);
const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);
if (docSnap.exists()) {
  console.log("Document data:", docRef.data());
} else {
  console.log("No such document!");
}
```

---

## Read All Documents

- `collection()` is a reference to a collection
- `getDocs()` is an asynchronous function that is used to retrieve all documents in a collection

```javascript
const ref = collection(db, "blog-posts");
const docs = await getDocs(ref);
docs.forEach((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.id, " => ", doc.data());
});
```

---

## Update a Document

- `updateDoc()` is an asynchronous function that updates a document

```javascript
const docRef = doc(db, "blog-posts", id);
await updateDoc(docRef, {
  title: "New Title",
  content: "New Content",
});
```

---

## Delete a Document

- `deleteDoc()` is an asynchronous function that deletes a document

```javascript
const docRef = doc(db, "blog-posts", id);
await deleteDoc(docRef);
```

---

## Accessing Subcollections

- `collection()` and `doc()` can be used to access subcollections too
- Example: Suppose we have a collection of users, each with a collection of items

```javascript
// Get a reference to the items collection for a specific user
const itemsCollection = collection(db, "users", userId, "items");

// Or, get a reference to a specific item document
const itemDoc = doc(db, "users", userId, "items", itemId);
```

---

## Next.js Routing

- Next.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes
- `page.js` is a special file is used to make route segments publicly accessible
- e.g. `app/about/page.js` will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/about`

> But what if we want to create dynamic routes like `/blog/123`?

---

## Next.js Dynamic Routing

- Folder name is enclosed in square brackets `app/blog/[id]/page.js`
- prop `params` is a promise resolving to an object with the route parameters

## Coding Demo

- Add Cloud Firestore to the Week 9 Demo

  - In the menu on the left, click "Build" and then "Firestore Database"
  - Add to the existing Firebase project
  - Choose "Start in test mode"

- Demo a simple blog app with Next.js and Cloud Firestore
